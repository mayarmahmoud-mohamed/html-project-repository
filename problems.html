<p style="font-size:25px">1- Loss of jobs

Much of the functionality will be replaced by an AI client that does the same tasks that humans do, with much higher efficiency and much lower cost without tiredness or boredom. Making layoffs is the only solution for an organization that wants to stay in the market and compete with the rest.


<p style="font-size:25px">2- An increase in the difference in income between the rich and the poor
Where, due to the loss of many of their jobs, it will result in a decrease in the income of some classes, offset by a very high productivity of companies. As it brings huge profits to those companies that are quick to adopt these technologies. The result is that employers will increase their wealth significantly. Amazon has a market value of one trillion dollars, and its owner Bezos has a fortune of $ 110 billion !! Increasing the income gap reduces the stability of society as a whole


<p style="font-size:25px">3- Artificial intelligence bias against some ethnicities and genders
The problem is that all of these techniques are trained with a lot of data. This data is usually collected from an educated and velvet class with specific characteristics, which makes the data biased and consequently the resulting AI will become biased. Example: Many companies use algorithms to predict the employeeâ€™s effectiveness before accepting him to the job, and he may deny him the job if the prediction is bad. The algorithm may prefer white skin over brown skin in the job based on certain statistics favoring whites were used in training the algorithm !! There are some organizations that have recently aimed to spread the culture of justice in artificial intelligence and companies working to reduce the bias of artificial intelligence
