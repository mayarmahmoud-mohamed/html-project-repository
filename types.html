<p style="font-size:25px">Artificial Intelligence technology is classified into three categories: Narrow Artificial Intelligence (ANI), General Artificial Intelligence (AGI), and Superior Artificial Intelligence (ASI).
1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence 
It refers to artificial intelligence systems that can only perform specific tasks independently and with capabilities that mimic human capabilities. This means that these systems are limited in capabilities and their capabilities do not go beyond the tasks designed for them. All contemporary applications of artificial intelligence, including the most complex and the most powerful, fall into this category. By referring to the first method of classification, they include interactive and limited-memory machines without exception for systems that use "machine learning" and "deep learning".
2. Artificial General Intelligence:
It means the ability of artificial intelligence to learn, perceive, understand and act just like a human by simulating human capabilities. These systems will be able to build a variety of capacities and reach links and generalizations across several areas, which would reduce much of the time needed to train these systems.
3. Artificial Super intelligence:
The development of super artificial intelligence is probably the culmination of research in this field. Given that AI will be considered, when developed, will be the most capable form of intelligence on Earth, superior AI will be distinguished at all levels thanks to its superior memory, fast data processing and analysis, and decision-making capabilities.
The development of these two types of artificial intelligence will lead to what is often referred to as “technological singularity” when technological advances transcend humans ’ability to guide and control. The conception of such highly developed systems creates impressive visions of civilization progress, but their existence may threaten the existence of humans or at the very least it will threaten the foundations of life as humans have entrusted them.
