<p style="font-size:25px">1- Natural Language Generation NLG
It works on creating useful content by interpreting the available data set, as this technology has the ability to process huge amounts of data in a few seconds, and convert it into a written language that is easy for people to understand, as this science has shown itself through its ability to display financial reports and descriptions Products, network profiles, marketing plans, and more within a very short time


<p style="font-size:25px">2- Emotion Recognition
It is a technology that exists in a program that enables it to read the reactions of the human face using advanced image processing techniques, a recent trend in the areas of artificial intelligence today, and companies have also tried to combine the complex algorithms and image processing techniques that appeared in the last ten years to obtain On a deeper understanding of human feelings through the image of his face.




<p style="font-size:25px">3-deep Learning
Deep learning is one of the most common Fields of artificial intelligence today, and it is a function of artificial intelligence that simulates the way the human mind works to process data and create patterns that can be used in decision-making, and is actually a subset of Machine Learning but more deep and complex, and it is also called Deep neuronal learning.




<p style="font-size:25px">4- Speech Recognition
The most prominent fields of applied artificial intelligence, which means the ability of the program to identify spoken words and phrases and convert them into a machine-readable pattern automatically, as the system of primitive speech recognition contains specific vocabulary and phrases, and it requires you to speak very clearly to understand this speech, either in more modern systems As she developed, she became able to understand what is being said naturally in speaking situations.

    <td>Roports</td>
    <td>it is one of the fields in which artificial intelligence has entered, since the robot is a mechanical device designed to perform the tasks that people do in general, and the invention of modern robots has led to the emergence of countless devices and machines that replace work Individuals. It is worth noting that most of the robots are based on software to operate independently of direct human control, and the term is also used for vehicles and other machines that are controlled remotely by the human operator.</td>

    <td>The development of computer programs</td>
    <td>artificial intelligence led to the development of computer programs, examples of which are Chess programs on computers. In 1948, the British mathematician Alan Turing developed a chess algorithm, where mathematical software was used, and after ten years, the American mathematician Claude Shannon drew an algorithm to play chess by two people on a computer, this software calculates all possible moves for each player, and the consequences as far as possible for the moves.</td>
